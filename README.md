This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a simple app to play around with the Spotify API. This app iuses Authorization Code Flow, which is not entirely well suited to SPA so could be updated.

This web app will display 20 newest releases.

To run the application locally, do the following:
```bash
# clone the repo
$ git clone git@github.com:Darren-Ivey/spotify-test-app.git
$ cd spotify-test-app

# install the dependencies
$ npm install

# start the UI
$ npm run dev

# start the backend
$ cd service

# install the dependencies
$ npm install

# start the backend
$ npm run start

```
